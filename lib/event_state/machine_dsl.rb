    # The machine changes state in response to a message being sent or received,
    # and you can register an {#on_enter} handler that is specific to the

    # will be called if no more specific handler was found (see example below).

    # called from EventMachine's +post_init+ method. In this case (and only this
    # case), the message passed to the block is +nil+.

    #   state :foo do
