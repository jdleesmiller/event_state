module EventState
  #
  # Base class for state machines driven by +EventMachine+.
  #
  # This class provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for declaring the
  # structure of the machine. See the {file:README} for examples and the general
  # idea of how this works.
  #
  # If you are sending ruby objects as messages, see {ObjectMachine}; it handles
  # serialization (using EventMachine's +ObjectProtocol+) and names messages
  # according to their classes (but you can easily override this).
  #
  # If you have some other kind of messages, then you should subclass this class
  # directly. Three methods are required:
  # 1. Override EventMachine's +receive_data+ method to call
  #    {#transition_on_recv} with the received message.
  # 2. Override EventMachine's +send_data+ method to call {#transition_on_send}
  #    with the message to be sent.
  # 3. Override {#message_name}. This takes a message to be sent or received and
  #    determines its name, which relates the message to the declared protocol.

      # this method.

      # The machine changes state in response to a message being sent or
      # received, and you can register an {on_enter} handler that is specific
      # to the message that caused the change. Or you can render a catch-all
      # block that will be called if no more specific handler was found (see
      # example below).

      # called from EventMachine's +post_init+ method. In this case (and only
      # this case), the message passed to the block is +nil+.
      #
      # @example
      #   state :foo do
