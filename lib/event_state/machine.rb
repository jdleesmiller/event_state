module EventState
  #
  # Base class for state machines driven by +EventMachine+.
  #
  # This class provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for declaring the
  # structure of the machine. See the {file:README} for examples and the general
  # idea of how this works.
  #
  # If you are sending ruby objects as messages, see {ObjectMachine}; it handles
  # serialization (using EventMachine's +ObjectProtocol+) and names messages
  # according to their classes (but you can override this).
  #
  # If you have some other kind of messages, then you should subclass this class
  # directly. Two methods are required:
  # 1. Override EventMachine's +receive_data+ method to call
  #    {#transition_on_recv} with the received message.
  # 2. Override EventMachine's +send_data+ method to call {#transition_on_send}
  #    with the message to be sent.
  # Note that {#transition_on_recv} and {#transition_on_send} take a message
  # _name_ as well as a message. You have to define the mapping from messages
  # to message names so that the message names correspond with the transitions
  # declared using the DSL ({on_send} and {on_recv} in particular).
  #
  class Machine < EventMachine::Connection

      # Declare the protocol; pass a block to declare the {state}s.
      #
      # When the block terminates, this method declares any 'implicit' states
      # that have been referenced by {on_send} or {on_recv} but that have not
      # been declared with {state}. It also does some basic sanity checking.
      #
      # There can be multiple protocol blocks declared for one class; it is
      # equivalent to moving all of the definitions to the same block.
